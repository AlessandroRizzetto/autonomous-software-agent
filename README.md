# Autonomous Software Agent Client Application

The client application is designed to work as an autonomous software agent that plays a game where the goal is to
collect parcels and deposit them on special tiles. The agent will be able to navigate through a virtual world, pick
up parcels, and deliver them to their destination tiles, while avoiding obstacles and other agents. The application
will utilize a combination of algorithms and techniques, such as pathfinding, autonomous reasoning, and
decision-making, to enable the agent to make intelligent decisions and perform effectively in the game.
